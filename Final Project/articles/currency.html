			<h1>As scarcity of chicken nuggets increases, governments declare chicken nuggets as a <b><i><span class="highlight">“global currency”</span>.</i></b></h1>

			<p class="info text">Posted October 21st, 2020</p>
			<p class="text">In the past decades, chicken nuggets have been consumed throughout the world. However, with the Great Chicken Shortage, laws limiting the number of chicken nuggets that can be eaten per day have been passed. There are known to be approximately 836 chicken nuggets left in the world, making it one of the rarest items in the world.
				Being so rare, each nugget is associated with an extremely large amount of money. Currently the conversion rate is 1 nugget for roughly $130,000, but economists predict that the price of chicken nuggets will increase up to $576,000 per nugget in 2022 due to some people inevitably eating them, decreasing the supply.
				</p>

			<p class="text">For comparison, there are 21 million Bitcoin around the world, making it 25,000x more common than chicken nuggets. Bitcoin’s price peaked at roughly $20,000 in late-2017 
				and now is worth roughly $7,000 per coin.
			</p>

			<p class="text">“Who is lucky enough to have a nugget?” you may ask. In fact, the nuggets have not been distributed very fairly. Many of the richest people in the world have tens, if not hundreds of chicken nuggets. Jeff Bezos is known to have at least 300 of the nuggets in the world. We tried to reach out to Mr. Bezos to ask him about his nuggets, 
				but he aggressively declined exclaiming <i>“NO ONE TOUCHES MY NUGGIES.”</i> We have yet to hear back from any other proud nugget owners.

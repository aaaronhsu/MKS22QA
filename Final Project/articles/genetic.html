			<h1>Genetically modifying ducks into chickens could be the future.</h1>

			<p class="info text">Posted October 18th, 2020</p>
			<p class="text">Genetic modification has taken large strides in the past decades, with genetically modified crops having one of the largest impacts on today’s society. However, new studies 
				show that genetically modifying ducks into chickens may be possible in the near future. By editing the RJF-BEC gene present in ducks, more fat can be converted into meat, producing a 
				leaner, more chicken-like duck. Although this may not be the most accurate recreation of a chicken, it does get us one step closer to each of us having our very own “chicken” nugget.
				</p>

			<p class="text">Many experiments have already been conducted on ducks. Studies have shown that the mortality rates of ducks that are experimented on is near 60% a week after genetic 
				modification. However, death rates are expected to decrease exponentially, down to 5% through more testing.
			</p>

			<p class="text">Despite this, some are still critical of these experiments. “Why are we killing innocent ducks for meat that isn’t even genuine chicken meat?” Riots have been seen 
				outside many of these genetic modification labs, but were quickly defused by the police.
			</p>

			<p class="text"><a href="https://precisionbiosciences.com/" target="_blank">Precision BioSciences</a>, a large corporation making major strides in genetic modification is asking owners of chicken nuggets to send their nugget over for genetic sequencing. 
				They are paying up to $200,000 for high quality, minimally processed chicken nuggets. If you have a chicken nugget that you are willing to sell, please reach out to them.

			<h1>Chicken products fly off shelves within days. Grocery store brawls spotted across the country.</h1>
			<p class="info text">Posted October 20th, 2020</p>
			<p class="text">The lack of chickens around the world has led to many chicken products around the world to go out of stock, namely chicken nuggets. Prices for chicken products have skyrocketed since the announcement that chickens were put on the WWF endangered species list in July 2020. Whole chickens went from $23 each to over a thousand in 
				less than a month, with no indication of the price inflation slowing down.
			</p>

			<p class="text">Grocery stores around the world have transformed into centers of violence with brawls frequently occurring over chicken products. In an attempt to reduce injuries in stores, the United States passed laws last week, stating that at least 2 police officers must be present at every grocery store. Australia and Indonesia have passed 
				further laws, closing all grocery stores temporarily until the chicken shortage issue is resolved. However, these laws have been controversial, as the owners of grocery stores must hire police officers to stand guard at their stores. This led to many small grocery stores to shut down, as the price for these police guards were quite high.

			<p class="text">In addition to many local grocery stores failing, many large fast food chains have suffered. Fast food giants such as Mc. Donalds, Burger King, and Wendys have taken a hit on their sales with an average of 23% fewer sales. Popeyes and KFC have endured even more with their sales dropping over 90%. It is expected that these numbers 
				will continue to decrease, and eventually lead to the demise of these fast food chains.

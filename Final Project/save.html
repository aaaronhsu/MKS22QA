			<h3>Over the past couple years, life has not treated you well. 
				You were kicked out of your mom’s basement because you stole 
				your mom’s credit card and spent all of her money on Fortnite, 
				with dreams of being an <span class="red">epic gamer</span> one day.
			</h3>

			<h3>You pace around the streets, your new home, thinking of ways to 
				save yourself. With the chicken pandemic sweeping the world, 
				<span class="highlight">everyone is craving chicken nuggets</span>. You decide to open up your 
				own restaurant to serve this growing demand for chicken nuggets 
				with your very own nugget recipe. Save both yourself and the world 
				right?
			</h3>

			<h3>You open your restaurant and realize that you don’t know how to 
				make any type of nugget. You consult the internet and they give 
				you a couple recommendations. It’s your job to <span class="highlight">
				craft the perfect nugget recipe</span> to satisfy the growing demand 
				for nuggets.
